## List of 1:n Trip Proposals. Intermodal Router [/imp-endpoint/api/V1/TripProposals/IMR] 

This collection contains list of trip proposals for 1:n routing with information about tip costs (duration, price and distance) and an URL to request more details about the trip.
Notes:
- criteria for selection of tripproposal are specified in the request body
- start location is in all trip proposals the same, destination is in every proposal different.
- the trip proposals can be multimodal or intermodal, depending on which routing service the user is subscribed to.

The data structure of collection contains a list of trip proposals. Each trip proposal contains the following attributes:

attribute | json data type | comments
--- | --- | ---
url | URI | URI to request more details about a specific route
origin | Object | timed start point of the trip
destination | Object | timed end point of the trip
trafficTypes | Array | list of traffic types used in the proposed trip  
description | String |

# Group Billing
This is a group of all rest resources related to IMP billing service.
IMP offers this REST interface to its Partner (Service Providers and Mobility Providers) to provide billable events to IMP in order to use its billing functionality. Partners can provide events to IMP, but can't retrieve them.
IMP uses this REST interface internally to create IMP BillableEvents and retrieve them for internal purposes.

## BillableEvent [/imp-endpoint/api/V1/Billing/BillableEvents/{id}]
One billable event. Can be a single time event (Buying a Ticket) or a event with end and start time (enter parking lot & exit parking lot)

The data structure of a billable event has the following attributes:

attribute | json data type | comments
--- | --- | ---
id | String | id of the event. (auto generated value)
uri | String | URI of the resource "Billing/BillableEvents/1"
eventTimestamp | String | Timestamp when this event occurred in ISO 8601 format: YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ssTZD (eg 1997-07-16T19:20:30+01:00) (mandatory)
userId | String | Id of customer to whom this event shall be accounted to (mandatory). NOTE: This can be id of a traveler, of a mobilitly provider, or a combined id, e.g. mp1_traveller2
extUserId | String | External Id of customer to whom this event shall be accounted (optional). NOTE: this field can be used as traveler id.
transactionId | String | Unique id of a transaction this event belongs to (optional) Example usage: both events "enter parking" & "exit parking" would have the same transaction id
productCode | String | This code determines the consumed product and has to correlate with the defined product in the billing system (mandatory)
productName | String | Readable public name of the productCode (optional)
vendorId | String | Id of entity that created this event (mandatory) NOTE: this can be MP_ID, SP_ID, or IMP
quantity | Float | Quantity of consumption (optional)
quantityType | String | Type of consumed quantity (e.g. units, seconds, kilometers, liters, â€¦) (optional)
price | Float | Price of this event. If this field is filled the event is considered as already rated (optional)
currency | String | Currency code according to ISO 4217 for currency conversion purposes. Default: EUR
serviceCategory | String | Category of the service eg. Parking, CarSharing, etc. (optional)
serviceId | String | Id of the service that has been used to create this event (optional). One serviceProvider can offer different services (offerings) identified by this id.
serviceProviderId | String | Id of the service provider (mandatory). NOTE: this field is SP_ID
quota | Object | optional object used in case of more complex event & price models. (optional) Note: if this field exists, "price" and "quantity" are overridden. 

The data structure of the quota object:

attribute | json data type | comments
--- | --- | ---
quotaType | String | Defines the type of the quota. This shall be used in order to correctly cast the quota attributes. (mandatory)
duration | long | A time dimension. Default unit: millis (optional)
startTimestamp | String | Start of the duration. Timestamp in ISO 8601 format (eg 1997-07-16T19:20:30+01:00) (optional)
endTimestamp | long | End of the duration. Timestamp in ISO 8601 format (eg 1997-07-16T19:20:30+01:00) (optional)
startLatLng | Object | Start of distance measuring. Geoposition in format specified as Point conform to the following GeoJSON Format Specification: http://geojson.org/geojson-spec.html (optional)
endLatLng | Object | End of distance measuring. Geoposition in format specified as Point conform to the following GeoJSON Format Specification: http://geojson.org/geojson-spec.html (optional)
distance | Float | Distance in distance units determined by unit type
distanceUnit | String | Unit for distance (sample: meters, TODO: is there a norm?)
units | Float | Generic quota field (optional)
unitType | String | Determines unit type of the quota (meters, kg, hours, â€¦) Default: meters (optional)
namedEvent | String | Any kind of additional identification or description (optional)

### Retrieve a single billable event [GET]

+ Parameters
    + id (string, `111`) ... an event id

## BillableEvents Collection [/imp-endpoint/api/V1/Billing/BillableEvents?userId={userId}&serviceProviderId={serviceProviderId}&startDate={date1}&endDate={date2}]  
A list of billable events happened in the specified date slot and filtered by userId (can be traveler id, mobility provider id or combined id "mp1_traveler2") or by serviceProviderIds.
In case no filters were specified, the last x items should be returned.

Idea: Ids chain through MP->IMP->SP is realized as follows: a traveler at MP with `travelerId`, a MP at IMP with `mpId`, so the traveller at IMP with `mpId_travelerId`
All BillableEvents (produced in IMP) contain attribute userId in form `mpId_travelerId`, billableEvents provided by MPs, or SPs can provide different id schema

Note: userToken is used in header to check the rights to see billable events. Currently GET methods are planned for internal IMP use only.
